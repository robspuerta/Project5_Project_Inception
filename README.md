# Product Inception (--Under Construction--)
<img src="https://github.com/robspuerta/Project5_Project_Inception/blob/main/Github%20banner.png" /> 

Any product, as an adventure with your friends, requires everybody to be aligned on what to expect in this journey. Some might be focusing on being compliant with a new law, others on sustainable growth, optimizing internal processes, or even on improving customer experience (check [22 types of business objectives to measure success](https://asana.com/resources/business-objectives-examples)). Having all this in consideration...

### How do we align stakeholders' expectations on the upoming product?

Luckily, Agile presents a solution like a <ins> "pre-phase" stage where gathering stakeholders is required to determine key aspects</ins> like objectives, scope, roadmap, expected delivered value and how to measure it; and some other aspects like high-level user stories and requirements. This exercise might take a whole business day, but believe me, it is better to take one day to understand what we expect from this project than one day to explain why it fails to fulfill unknown expectations.

## Practical exercise: Online Marketplace

A Marketplace is a web-based platform where customers can buy from different online stores. This is the case for MercadoLibre or Amazon. From the business / technical point of view, it has some complexities like different types of Clients, each with their customer paths, different technologies involved, legal considerations, competition, and more.

Now, imagine we have to create this platform from the beginning or just want to get to know the ongoing product. I have personally gathered these **5** tools to make the Project Inception, but these are not mandatory, only #2 and #3 are highly-recommended on the Agile framework, but each one of them has its advantages. 

### #1. Business Model Canvas

This tool creates a visual representation of our business model, aligning **WHAT we do, HOW we do it and WHO are our clients**. This is a very interesting tool I have used with strategic and core teams (not all stakeholders) and the most common result is understanding that everybody has different perspectives on many items, especially on "Clients" and "Services".

### #2. Impact Mapping

It's a mind map that links **WHY** are we doing it, **WHO** is involved, **HOW** positively impact them, and **WHAT** is needed to achieve it. This can be done as a workshop with key stakeholders and the result is a great way to visualize roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher-level organizational goals.

### #3. User Story Mapping
After a quick break from the Impact Mapping, comes the "User Story Mapping". Here we ***slice*** the **WHAT** from the previous exercise into more detail.

During this workshop, I recommended understanding, through the eyes of the stakeholders, what the product should-have, could-have, won't-have ([MoSCoW](https://airfocus.com/glossary/what-is-moscow-prioritization/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMoSCoW%E2%80%9D%20is%20an%20acronym%20for,for%20each%20level%20of%20priority.)), and make some quick voting to understand what is more important to them. All this will add more info for ***prioritize***. 

Then it is all about arranging the ***planned realize***. 

### #4. Project Objectives Vs Business Objective

The idea is to link the Project Objectives Vs Business Objective by using a simple matrix and using a relative ponderation (i.e. 1 has minimum impact and 5 direct impacts). Then repeat the exercise but now link User Stories from (#2 Impact mapping) and Project Objectives. This can be done with all the stakeholders right after Impact and User Story Mapping, or just with the strategic and core team if the workshop exceeds the time available.

I haven't found proper documentation about this exercise but it is a great idea to align and match the organization's strategic goals with the product strategy, and to understand how each requirement has an impact on the company, for example, "User Story #3" has a low impact on Project Objectives, therefore, it has no priority with the Project or the Company, a lot of time and effort has been avoided with this.

### #5. Customer Journey Map
This is a very interesting exercise to do. This allows understanding, for each type of Customer, its complete life cycle, considering actions, tools used, what information is needed, where we need KPIs. All this gives a huge perspective of the "whole" project.


Preparing these workshops, gathering documentation, coordinating the workshops, and subsequently, processing all the information can take one or two weeks depending on the size and complexity of the project, stakeholders' familiarity with these dynamics, and more. But the results bring light into what's important, what has a good or bad impact, hidden risks, and expectations. 

Let me know in the comments how would you align expectations or get to fully know a product from the inside.
