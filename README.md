# Project Inception

Any project, as an adventure with your friends, requieres everybody to be align to what to expect in this journey, some might be focusing on being compliance with a new law, others on sustainable growth, optimizee internal processes or even on improving customer experience (check [22 types of business objectives to measure success](https://asana.com/resources/business-objectives-examples)). Having all this in consideration....

### How do we align stakeholders expections?

Luckily, Agile presents a solution like a <ins> "pre-phase" stage where gathering stakeholders is required to determine key aspects</ins> like objectives, scope, roadmap, expected delivered value and how to measure it; and some others aspects like high-level user stories and requirements. This excercise might take a whole business day, but believe me, it is better to take one day to understand what we expect from this project than one day to explain why it fails to fullfill unknown expectations.

## Practical exercise: Online Marketplace

A Marketplace is a web-based platform where a customer can buy from different online stores. This is the case for MercadoLibre or Amazon. From the business / technical point of views, it has some complexities like different type of Clients, each one with different customer's paths, different technologies involved, legal considerations, competition and more.

Now, imagine we have to create this platform from the beginning or just want to get to know the on-going product. I have personally gathered this 5 tools to make the Project Inception, but these are not mandatory, only #2 and #3 are highly recommended on Agile framework, but each one of them has their advantages. 

### #1. Business Model Canvas

This tool creates a visual representation of our business model, aligning **WHAT we do, HOW we do it and WHO are our clients**. This is a very interesting tool I have used with strategic and core teams (not all stakeholders) and the most common result is understanding that everybody has different perspective on many items, especially on "Clients" and "Services".

### #2. Impact Mapping

Its a mind map that links **WHY** are we doing it, **WHO** is involved, **How** positively impact them, and **WHAT** is needed to achieve it. This can be done as a workshop with key stakeholders and the result is a great wat to visualise roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs, and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher level organisational goals.

### #3. User Story Mapping

### #4. Project Objectives Vs Business Objective

The idea is to link the Project Objectives Vs Business Objective by using a simple matrix, and using a relative ponderation (i.e. 1 has minimum impact and 5 direct impact). Then repeat the excersice but now linking User Stories from (#2 Impact mapping) and Project Objetives. This can be done with all the stakeholders right after Impact and User Story Mapping, or just with strategic and core team if the workshop exceed the time available.

I haven't found proper documentation about this excersise but it is a great idea to align and match the organization strategic goals with the product strategy, and to understand how each requirement has an impact in the company, for example, "User Story #3" has low impact on Project Objectives, therefore, it has no priority with the Project or the Company, a lot of time and effort has been avoided with this.

### #5. Customer Journey Map


Conclusion y responder la pregunta

Let me know in the comments how would you align expectations or get to fully know a product from the inside.
